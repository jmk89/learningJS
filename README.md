# learningJS
From the Udemy course by Max Schwarzmuller

## background
I started web dev with an Angular crash course, and then a complete guide of Angular, and then Angularfire. I realized I could work with Angular to a working level, but I feel like I was missing some foundations of web dev. So I started a full HTML/CSS course which is taking me all the way up to sass, and now I'm taking a complete guide of javascript to fill in knowledge gaps.

## purpose
In addition to my personal course notes and the course videos, I'm working with this repo to keep a catalog of notes. The first several sections will be somewhat dull, as they cover data types, operators, debugging, if/else blocks, functions, and OOP. I'm looking forward to events, libraries & frameworks, promises & callbacks, as well as nodejs and testing.

## commits
I learn better when I get the chance to re-explain topics. So the commits will be frequent during sections when I'm trying to solidify new neural pathways.
